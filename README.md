A spatial examination racial-ethnic population patterns in Atlanta from 1990-2010 using conditional autoregressive (CAR) models

During the 1990s and 2000s, the U.S. experienced significant shifts in immigration patterns. Immigrants settled outside of traditional destination cities – like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles – in favor of new metropolitan areas in the Sunbelt region that previously had little history of immigration. Using Census data from 1990, 2000, and 2010, this project examines Black, Latinx, Asian, and White population patterns in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area, a quickly emerging immigrant destination in the South. 

I map these racial group population patterns in relation to each other to understand the changing racial geoography of the American South. I then use a stock and flow framework from the classic growth formula to analyze what neighborhood characteristics influence these patterns. The stock-flow framework allows me to ask two simple, but crucial questions: where do people live? And where are they growing? I add a spatial parameter to these models to capture the spatial relationships between neighborhoods. By introducing this spatial parameter to the classic growth model, I challenge the common aspatial methods of examining population growth especially in the study of the South.
